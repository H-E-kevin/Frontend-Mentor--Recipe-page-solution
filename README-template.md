## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts. I also improved my skills in semantic HTML5 markup and CSS custom properties.

```html
<ul>
	<li><span>Total:</span> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
	<li><span>Preparation:</span> 5 minutes</li>
	<li><span>Cooking:</span> 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
```

```css
@media all and (max-width: 375px) {
	#container {
		width: 37.5rem;
		margin: 0;
	}

	body {
		font-size: 16px;
	}

	p {
		font-size: 14px;
	}

	.attribution {
		font-size: 12px;
	}
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on writing more efficient and shorter code especially in css.
